# Edge Use Cases
Edge computing covers many, many use cases. This list comprises just some of the use cases that we at Rancher Labs have encountered in conversations with prospects and customers. All of these edge use cases can benefit from container orchestration in some way. 

Some of the use cases below may be combined for various industries and extended user stories. The list attempts to provide a basic overview of possibilities. Following the link to each use case will provide a short, opinionated list of devices which might be used to demonstrate the use case in action. In many cases, the number of nodes suggested is simply a minimum number to achieve the desired goal. 

In those cases where demos have previously been done and documentation exists, links will also be provided.
